## Introduction

Building a portfolio website is a rite of passage for developers. After several iterations and false starts, I finally created a portfolio I'm proud of using React, Bootstrap, and Vite. Here's what I learned along the way.

## Why React?

I chose React for several reasons:
- **Component reusability** - Build once, use everywhere
- **Modern tooling** - Vite provides lightning-fast development
- **Flexibility** - Full control over design and functionality
- **Learning opportunity** - Deepen my frontend skills

## Design Philosophy

### Keep It Simple

I've seen portfolios that are visual masterpieces but impossible to navigate. My priority was:
1. **Clarity** - Make it obvious what I do
2. **Speed** - Fast loading times
3. **Accessibility** - Keyboard navigation, screen reader support
4. **Responsiveness** - Perfect on mobile and desktop

### Dark Mode First

I designed for dark mode from the start, then adapted for light mode. Dark mode is easier on the eyes and popular with developers (my target audience).

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Vite Over Create React App

Vite offers:
- Instant server start
- Lightning-fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- Optimized builds
- Better developer experience

Setup was simple:
```bash
npm create vite@latest portfolio -- --template react
```

### 2. Bootstrap for Rapid Prototyping

Bootstrap accelerated development:
- Responsive grid system out of the box
- Pre-built components (cards, buttons, navbar)
- Consistent spacing and typography

I customized Bootstrap variables to match my color scheme and removed unused components to keep the bundle size down.

### 3. CSS Custom Properties for Theming

Theme switching is powered by CSS custom properties:

```css
[data-theme="dark"] {
    --bg-color: #1a171e;
    --text-color: #e8e8e8;
    --primary-color: #9378bc;
}

[data-theme="light"] {
    --bg-color: #fdfffd;
    --text-color: #2a2a2a;
    --primary-color: #4a9d7a;
}
```

JavaScript toggles the `data-theme` attribute:
```javascript
document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', theme);
```

## Key Features

### 1. Project Showcase

Each project card includes:
- **Title and description**
- **Tech stack badges**
- **Live demo and GitHub links**
- **Expandable details** (challenges, solutions, outcomes)

Cards are clickable, accessible, and visually engaging.

### 2. Skills Section with Flip Cards

Interactive skill cards flip on click to reveal:
- Description of my proficiency
- Projects where I used the technology

Built with pure CSS transforms:
```css
.skill-flip-card.flipped .skill-flip-inner {
    transform: rotateY(180deg);
}
```

### 3. Smooth Scroll Navigation

Used Intersection Observer API to:
- Highlight active section in navbar
- Trigger scroll-based animations
- Lazy load images for performance

### 4. Performance Optimizations

- **Image optimization** - Compressed PNGs/JPEGs with vite-plugin-image-optimizer
- **Code splitting** - Lazy load components with React.lazy()
- **Minification** - Vite handles this automatically
- **Hosting** - Deployed to GitHub Pages with custom domain

Result: **Lighthouse score of 95+** across all metrics.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Theme Persistence

**Problem**: Theme resets on page reload.

**Solution**: Store preference in localStorage:
```javascript
const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'dark';
setTheme(savedTheme);
```

### Challenge 2: Smooth Scroll on iOS

**Problem**: Smooth scrolling didn't work on iOS Safari.

**Solution**: Used `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })` with a polyfill fallback.

### Challenge 3: Build Path Issues

**Problem**: Assets didn't load on GitHub Pages due to incorrect base path.

**Solution**: Configure Vite's base path:
```javascript
base: process.env.GITHUB_PAGES ? "/Portfolio/" : "/"
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Design Tokens Are Essential

Defining colors, spacing, and typography as CSS variables upfront made theming and consistency trivial.

### 2. Accessibility Matters

Adding ARIA labels, focus states, and keyboard navigation took extra time but made the site usable for everyone.

### 3. Less Is More

I removed fancy animations that didn't add value. Subtle transitions are more professional.

### 4. Mobile First Works

Designing for mobile first, then scaling up, resulted in a better responsive experience than the reverse.

## What's Next?

Future improvements I'm planning:
- **Blog section** - Share what I'm learning (you're reading this now!)
- **Analytics** - Track visitor behavior with privacy-friendly tools
- **CMS integration** - Make content updates easier
- **Automated testing** - Add E2E tests with Playwright

## Conclusion

Building this portfolio taught me more than any tutorial could. I learned to make design decisions, optimize for performance, and prioritize user experience. Most importantly, I now have a platform to showcase my work and share my journey as a developer.

If you're building your own portfolio, my advice:
- **Start simple** - Ship a basic version first
- **Iterate** - Improve based on feedback
- **Make it yours** - Don't copy templates blindly
- **Have fun** - It's your creative space!
