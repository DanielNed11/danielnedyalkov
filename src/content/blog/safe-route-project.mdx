## A New Semester, A New Challenge

A new semester has just started, and with it comes a project that immediately caught my attention.
For the Integration course, our team will build a full-stack application focused on **student safety, sustainability, and community**.

From the very first presentation, I knew this would be more than just another school assignment.
It is a real project for real stakeholders, which makes the learning experience far more meaningful.

## The Project Vision

The goal is to create a platform where students can **travel together to campus activities** instead of commuting alone.
By allowing students to create and join travel groups—whether walking, cycling, using public transport, or carpooling—the application aims to:

- improve safety during travel
- encourage sustainable transportation
- strengthen the student community
- support institutional climate goals

This combination of **social impact and technical complexity** is exactly the kind of challenge that motivates me.  [oai_citation:0‡Project description_Together Sustainable at Home_V 01 00.pdf](sediment://file_000000000f74722fa83cb16de37fb9dd)

## What We Will Build

Technically, the project requires designing a **complete web application** with:

- a REST-based backend
- a responsive frontend
- a PostgreSQL database
- authentication through institutional login
- integration with an external public transport API
- analytics showing usage and CO₂ savings

In other words, this is not just about coding features.
It is about building a **real, deployable system** that could genuinely be used by students.  [oai_citation:1‡Project description_Together Sustainable at Home_V 01 00.pdf](sediment://file_000000000f74722fa83cb16de37fb9dd)

## Why I’m Excited

What excites me most about this semester is the opportunity to:

- work in an Agile team with real stakeholders
- design software that has visible social impact
- deepen my full-stack development skills
- move closer to production-level engineering practices

Projects like this bridge the gap between **learning software development** and **actually being a developer**.

## Looking Ahead

Over the coming weeks, we will move from:

1. requirements and wireframes
2. to technical design
3. to working MVPs
4. and finally to a deployed cloud application

It will be challenging, and probably messy at times—but that is exactly where the real learning happens.

I’m looking forward to documenting the journey, the obstacles, and the lessons along the way.

This semester feels like an important step toward becoming a professional software developer.
