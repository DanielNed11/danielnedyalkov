## Introduction

Clean Tank is an IoT-based water quality monitoring system I built for aquarium management. The project combines hardware sensors, embedded programming, and a full-stack web application to provide real-time water quality insights.

## The Problem

Maintaining optimal water quality in an aquarium requires constant monitoring of multiple parameters:
- pH levels
- Temperature
- Turbidity (water clarity)
- Water level

Manual testing is tedious and doesn't provide continuous monitoring. I wanted to build a system that could track these metrics automatically and alert me to any issues.

## System Architecture

### Hardware Layer
- **Arduino Uno** - Main microcontroller
- **pH Sensor** - Monitors acidity/alkalinity
- **Temperature Sensor (DS18B20)** - Tracks water temperature
- **Turbidity Sensor** - Measures water clarity
- **Ultrasonic Sensor** - Monitors water level

### Backend Layer
- **Spring Boot** - REST API for data storage and retrieval
- **PostgreSQL** - Time-series data storage
- **Serial Communication** - Arduino-to-computer data transfer

### Frontend Layer
- **React** - Real-time dashboard
- **Chart.js** - Data visualization
- **Bootstrap** - Responsive UI

## Key Challenges

### 1. Sensor Calibration
Each sensor required precise calibration to ensure accurate readings. I had to develop calibration algorithms that accounted for environmental factors like ambient temperature affecting pH readings.

### 2. Data Reliability
Sensors occasionally produced noisy or invalid data. I implemented a moving average filter in the Arduino code to smooth out readings and discard outliers.

```cpp
float getFilteredReading(float newReading, float* readings, int size) {
    float sum = 0;
    for (int i = size - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        readings[i] = readings[i - 1];
        sum += readings[i];
    }
    readings[0] = newReading;
    sum += newReading;
    return sum / size;
}
```

### 3. Serial Communication
Establishing reliable communication between Arduino and the Spring Boot backend was tricky. I used a Python bridge script to read serial data and forward it to the API via HTTP requests.

## Results

The system successfully monitors water quality 24/7 and has helped me maintain a healthier aquarium environment. Key achievements:
- Real-time monitoring with 5-second update intervals
- Historical data tracking and trend analysis
- Automated alerts when parameters go out of range
- 99% uptime over 3 months of testing

## What I Learned

- **Hardware-Software Integration**: Bridging physical sensors with web applications
- **Data Processing**: Implementing filtering algorithms for noisy sensor data
- **System Design**: Building a full-stack IoT solution from scratch
- **Debugging**: Troubleshooting issues across hardware, embedded code, backend, and frontend

## Future Improvements

- Add automated water change system
- Implement machine learning to predict maintenance needs
- Build a mobile app for remote monitoring
- Add support for multiple tanks

## Conclusion

Clean Tank demonstrates how IoT technology can solve real-world problems. This project deepened my understanding of embedded systems, full-stack development, and system integration. It's one of my favorite projects because it combines multiple technical domains into a practical solution.
